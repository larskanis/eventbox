  # Mark an object as to be shared instead of copied.
  #
  # A marked object is never passed as copy, but passed as reference.
  # The object is therefore wrapped as {WrappedObject} or {ExternalObject} when used in an unsafe scope.
  # Objects marked within the event scope are wrapped as {WrappedObject}, which denies access from external/action scope or the event scope of a different Eventbox instance.
  # Objects marked in external/action scope are wrapped as {ExternalObject} which allows {External.send asynchronous calls} from event scope.
  # In all cases the object can be passed as reference and is automatically unwrapped when passed back to the original scope.
  # It can therefore be used to modify the original object even after traversing the boundaries.
  #
  # The mark is stored for the lifetime of the object, so that it's enough to mark only once at object creation.
  #
  # Due to {Eventbox::Sanitizer Sanitizer dissection} of non-marshalable objects, wrapping and unwrapping works even if the shared object is stored within another object as instance variable or within a collection class.
  # This is in contrast to â‚¬-variables which can only wrap the argument object as a whole when entering the event scope.
